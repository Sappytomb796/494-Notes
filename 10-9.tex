\section*{Network apps}

Client Server architecture\\
EX. Google Data Centers\\

Pure Peer to Peer architecture\\
no always on servers\\
Arbitrary end systems directly communicate\\
peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses\\

\noindent Pro: Highly scalable \\
\noindent Con: Difficult to manage\\
\indent\indent Unreliable\\
\indent\indent Lookup/Discovery\\


Hybrid of client-server and P2P\\
\noindent Skype:
\indent\indent Voice over is p2p\\
\indent\indent Chat/messages is client-server\\

Processes communication\\

Sockets\\
Process sends/receives messages to and from it's socket\\
Sockets are like doors; messages can come or go from them\\

Addressing processes\\
To receive messages, process must have identifier\\
host device a 32 bit IP address\\
Identifier includes both IP address and port numbers associated to process on host\\
HTTP server: Port 80\\
Mail server: Port 25\\

App Layer Protocol defines\\

What traspoirt services does an app need?
{\color{blue} Data Loss}
audio can tolerate some loss
file transfers require 100\% reliable data transfer

{\color{blue} Timing}
some apps require low delay to be effective
EX. Gaming

{\color{blue} Throughput}\\
some apps require minimm amount of throughput to be effective\\
other apps make use of what they get\\
EX. Tweet; does not require strong through put
EX. Video streaming MUST have strong through put

{\color{blue} Security}\\
Encryption, data integrity\\

Transport service requirements of common apps\\
Jitter: variation in average delay\\

%{r | l | l | l}
\bf{Application} & & &

Internet Transport protocols services\\
TCP service\\
connection oriented
reliable transport 
flow control

UDP service\\

Streaming multimedia \arr TCP, UDP, or SCTP\\

SCTP \arr TCP friendly congestion control but not reliable data transfer\\


\section*{Application Layer}

Web and HTTP\\
{\color{blue} web page} consists of objects\\
{\color{blue} base HTML file} which includes several referenced objects\\
Each object is addressable by a {\color{blue} URL}

HTTP Overview\\
HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol\\
{\color{blue} client}: browser that requests, receives, displays web objects\\
{\color{blue} server}: web server sends objects in response to requests\\
Uses TCP\\
HTTP is 'stateless'\\
\arr Protocols that maintain state are complex\\
Client sends a TCP SYN  Server sends an ack, client sends an http request.\\
non persistent HTTP\\
At most, one object is sent over TCP connection\\

Non persistent HTTP without piplining:\\
Client sends TCP SYN\\
Server sends TCP SYN and ACK\\
C sends HTTP Request\\
s sends object\\
c sends TCP FIN\\
c deciphers if it needs to ask for more objects;\\
C sends TCP SYN\\
s sends TCP SYN and ACK\\
c requests object 1\\
s sends object 1\\
c sends TCP FIN\\
c sends TCP SYN\\
s sends TCPY SYN and ACK\\
c requests object 2\\
s sends object 2\\
c sends TCP FIN\\
Every time the client recieves it's at 1RTT, so it totaled upto 6RTT for the whole interaction\\


persistent HTTP\\
Multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between a client and server\\
Client sends TCP SYN\\
Server sends TCP SYN and ACK\\
c requests http\\
s sends http\\
c requests object 1\\
s sends object 1\\
c requests object 2\\
s sends object 2\\
c sends TCP FIN\\
4 RTT for this interaction\\


Non persistent HTTP with piplining
C sends syn\\
s sends syn and ack\\
c sends http request\\
s sends http \\
c sends TCP FIN\\
Client sees there are two objects;\\
C sends SYN\\
S sends SYN and ACK\\
C requests object 1\\
c requests object 2\\
s sends object 1 \\
s sends object 2\\
c sends TCP FIN\\
4 RTT for this interaction\\

The best option is persistent with piplining.\\
With pipelining, the most objects we can request/send is 3 objects\\

If the objects are varied in size, you have to look at adding the transmission times for all 3 objects seperately\\

HTTP response status codes:\\
200 0k\\
301 Moved Permanently\\
